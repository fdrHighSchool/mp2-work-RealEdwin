# Letter Grade
#### Respond to the following:

1. Write a plan for the following extension:
  * Attach a "+" on their grade if the grade ends in a 7, 8 or 9 (eg: 78 -> C+, 89 -> B+)
  Make another variable and an if statement.
      int num2 = num % 10;
      if (num2 >=7) {
        System.out.println("A+");
      }
  * Attach a "-" on their grade if the grade ends in a 0, 1 or 2 (eg: 92 -> A-, 61 -> D-)
  Same thing as for "+" but instead replace the 7 with a 0 and 2

3. Discuss how you would make sure grades that are an F are not mislabeled as F- or F+ (eg: 49 -> F+ and 52 -> F-)
